OneToOne/OneToMany:

	Parent Child relationship:
		Which one can exist without the other?
		Which one come first?
		What happens if I delete one side of relationship to the other?
		Which one should I delete first?

	1) Join column on Child(Many) class
	2) MappedBy Child
	3) Cascade on Parent

	Best Practice:
	- Join on PrimaryId? (less readable)
	- Cascade All
	

ManyToMany

	- Avoid Cascade.All (entities have more than one meaningful connection.)
	-
